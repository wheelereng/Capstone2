Here we tested the functionality of the GUI interface, we included the expected data which is what the input is requiring 
of us, boundary values (which in this case is the numbers 0 and 10,000 as these are the default numbers we have configured 
when the GUI is launched) and erroneous values (anything that is outside the boundary and is of the wrong data type). 

Please see the image names for more details on what test is being carried out.
