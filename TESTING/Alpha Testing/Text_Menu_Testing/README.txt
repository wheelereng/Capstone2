Here we tested the functionality of the text menu, we included the expected data which is what the input is requiring of us, 
boundary values (which in this case is the numbers 0 and 10,000 as these are the default numbers we have configured) and 
erroneous values (anything that is outside the boundary and is the wrong data type). 

There was also a special case in regards to testing the denomination exclusion of 10p and having 10p as an input value. 
That was because there was no smaller denomination to consider as that was the smallest item on the list.

Please see the image file names for information on the particular test that is being shown.
