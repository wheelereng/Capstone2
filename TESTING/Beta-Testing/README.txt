For Beta testing, we allowed a small selected range of people we knew to test the calculator. 
This included people outside of the class to see if it’s user friendly and to find any possible bugs we haven’t thought of 
as a team before we officially release the calculator for public use. Here lies our results (taken 08/03/2021).

We have updated the program labels to tell the user that the input expects pence. We didn't have time to update the
remaining improvements before the launch deadline, however, these are points we can focus on for the next generation.
