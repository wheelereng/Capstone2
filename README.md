# Capstone2
A Capstone Project that sorts money into smaller denominations.

This was a week-long project that was completed during the IN4.0 Academy Internship by Jordan Wheeler, Jo Fountain, Alex Lescionok, Ben West and David Adewole. 

The aim of this project was to create a coin sorting application with a text menu option (Parts 1 and 2) and a GUI interface option (Part 3).
